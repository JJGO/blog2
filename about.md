I am Jose Javier Gonzalez and this is my personal blog where I talk about mathematics, programming and all sorts of puzzles. You can find more about me in my personal [webpage](http://josejg.com).

Most of the code for the blog can be found in my github {% include icon-github.html username="JJGO" %}.
